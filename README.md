# Product_Analysis_BI_Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard is built to analyze product performance across various categories â€” focusing on total sales, quantity sold, pricing, and more.

Itâ€™s more than just product analytics â€” itâ€™s a great project to **practice Data Cleaning**, build visuals, and explore real business insights.  
The dataset is **In the form of txt, its not clean so you will get a chance to perform data cleaning as well where is real world data is also not clean**, thats making it perfect for learning Power BI fundamentals.

## I practiced:
- Slicers with images/icons for a clean UX
- Trend lines (Total Sales by Month)
- Tree Maps and Pie Charts
- KPI cards with DAX measures
- Data modeling & transformation

I built this dashboard **while following a YouTube tutorial** initially. I used their dataset, and then extended the dashboard by applying my own logic, visuals, and learning.

## Personal Opinion 
This dashboard reflects not just a simple product analysis â€” but also gives you an opportunity to practice Data Cleaning and data storytelling.
The dataset used here is easy to understand and very beginner-friendly, making it perfect for students and learners getting started with Power BI.

## What I Explored While Making This Dashboard!
My favorite part was using the Key Influencers visual, a built-in AI feature in Power BI.
With just the right drag-and-drop of columns, it automatically analyzes what influences a certain outcome â€” like which products most impact a specific category. This can help businesses focus their strategy on those products!
